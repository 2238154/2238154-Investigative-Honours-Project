The aim of this study was to design a logistic regression model capable of predicting HCV infection outcome. Data from 134 individuals with acute HCV were analyzed to evaluate the association of 90 polymorphisms across 11 HLA genes with HCV infection outcome. Other variables included the individualâ€™s use of intravenous drugs, their sexual orientation as men that have sex with men, their status as being coinfected with HCV and HIV, their peak bilirubin concentration and whether they were carriers of an SNP on their IL28B gene.
